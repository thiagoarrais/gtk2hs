TODO for gtk2hs

11/2/2005 Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* rename these modules:
		Graphics/UI/Gtk/Misc/GArrow.chs
	to	Graphics/UI/Gtk/Misc/Arrow.chs
		Graphics/UI/Gtk/Windows/FileSel.chs
	to	Graphics/UI/Gtk/Selectors/FileSelection.chs

	* automake issues, building targets that are pulled in by the
	-include *.deps .depend lines somtimes seem to happen with the
	wrong $(NAME), so the CFLAGS or other $(NAME)-dependant variables
	come from the wrong package. To reproduce this problem set
	libmogul_a_CPPFLAGS =	#nothing

	* there sould be a rule to rebuild .chi files even if the corresponding
	.hs file still exists. Otherwise the build can stick and you have to
	delete the .hs file to unstick it. Each .chs file should depend on the
	.hs file and (or perhaps instead of) the .chi file.

	* Hierarchy.chs: c2hs 0.13.1 produces a with<Object> functions for
	every newtype definition. Import withForeignPtr for this.

28/07/2004  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* new gtk 2.2 & 2.4 APIs that need to be bound:
	action based manu API
		GtkUIManager
		GtkActionGroup
		GtkAction
		GtkToggleAction
		GtkRadioAction
		GtkToolItem
		GtkToolButton
		GtkSeparatorToolItem
		GtkToggleToolButton
		GtkRadioToolButton
	file selector stuff
		GtkFileFilter
	GtkPlug new stuff in gtk 2.2
		gtk_plug_construct_for_display (maybe)
		gtk_plug_new_for_display

* treeList/TreeStore.chs and treeList/ListStore.chs now use the preprocessor.
  The local c2hs is now able to run the preprocessor on those files that
  specify it in a pragma. An external c2hs would need to get preprocessed
  input. This has to be done in mk/library.mk .
