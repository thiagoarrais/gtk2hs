TODO for gtk2hs

24/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>
	
	* check the ref counting of BOXED obects in signal callbacks, eg Event

23/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* change gconf so it does not require -fallow-overlapping-instances

22/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* gtk/Graphics/UI/Gtk/Ornaments/Frame.chs: frameSetLabelAlign and
	frameGetLabelAlign only get/set the horazontal alignment not the
	verticle alighment too

12/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* glib timeouts and idle handlers:
	move them to glib package but re-export from gtk package
	make a newtype for priorities and add more of them
	make the IO Bool arg be the last arg so you can say:
	idleAdd priorityDefault $ do
	  ...

	add new menu toolbar API

	* refactor events interface. Problem with mem management (the region
	is destroied after the event handler completes) so perhaps make event
	structures abstract with accessor functions so for example the Region
	can be copied (with a destructor). Or Axel suggested a different
	signal, eg onExposeRegion

	* there sould be a rule to rebuild .chi files even if the corresponding
	.hs file still exists. Otherwise the build can stick and you have to
	delete the .hs file to unstick it. Each .chs file should depend on the
	.hs file and (or perhaps instead of) the .chi file.

	* Hierarchy.chs: c2hs 0.13.1 produces a with<Object> functions for
	every newtype definition. Import withForeignPtr for this.

28/07/2004  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* new gtk 2.2 & 2.4 APIs that need to be bound:
	action based manu API
		GtkUIManager
		GtkActionGroup
		GtkAction
		GtkToggleAction
		GtkRadioAction
		GtkToolItem
		GtkToolButton
		GtkSeparatorToolItem
		GtkToggleToolButton
		GtkRadioToolButton
	file selector stuff
		GtkFileFilter
	GtkPlug new stuff in gtk 2.2
		gtk_plug_construct_for_display (maybe)
		gtk_plug_new_for_display

* treeList/TreeStore.chs and treeList/ListStore.chs now use the preprocessor.
  The local c2hs is now able to run the preprocessor on those files that
  specify it in a pragma. An external c2hs would need to get preprocessed
  input. This has to be done in mk/library.mk .
