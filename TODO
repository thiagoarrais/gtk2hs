TODO for gtk2hs

	* automake issues, building targets that are pulled in by the
	-include *.deps .depend lines somtimes seem to happen with the
	wrong $(NAME), so the CFLAGS or other $(NAME)-dependant variables
	come from the wrong package. To reproduce this problem set
	libmogul_a_CPPFLAGS =	#nothing

	* there sould be a rule to rebuild .chi files even if the corresponding
	.hs file still exists. Otherwise the build can stick and you have to
	delete the .hs file to unstick it. Each .chs file should depend on the
	.hs file and (or perhaps instead of) the .chi file.

	* Hierarchy.chs: c2hs 0.13.1 produces a with<Object> functions for
	every newtype definition. Import withForeignPtr for this.

	* new gtk 2.2 & 2.4 APIs that need to be bound:
	action based manu API
		GtkUIManager
		GtkActionGroup
		GtkAction
		GtkToggleAction
		GtkRadioAction
		GtkToolItem
		GtkToolButton
		GtkSeparatorToolItem
		GtkToggleToolButton
		GtkRadioToolButton
	file selector stuff
		GtkFileFilter
	GtkPlug new stuff in gtk 2.2
		gtk_plug_construct_for_display (maybe)
		gtk_plug_new_for_display

* treeList/TreeStore.chs and treeList/ListStore.chs now use the preprocessor.
  The local c2hs is now able to run the preprocessor on those files that
  specify it in a pragma. An external c2hs would need to get preprocessed
  input. This has to be done in mk/library.mk .

older entries:

* Compilation falls over on FreeBSD when c2hs reads the type modifier
  __signed. I don't know if this is supposed to be replaced by cpp, for
  the time being I've just added -D__signed=signed.. There probably should
  be a autoconf test for this (and understanding of what's going on).

* Check all the files for additional functionality since 1.3.3.

* Add documentation support.

* Create automatic support for recursive make as it is done with applications
  and libraries. The Makefiles should be able to only specify three variables:
  TOOLMAKEDIRS (applications that are needed to build the libraries but which
  are not installed), LIBMAKEDIRS (the libraries that should be done next)
  and APPMAKEDIRS (which are applications which depend on the libraries). We
  need these three variables to get the sequence of inplace/noinplace right.
  Question: How do we reverse a list of words with make?
