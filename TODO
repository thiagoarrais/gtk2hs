TODO for gtk2hs

11/01/2003 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

* Change the return type of listStoreRemove and treeStoreRemove to Bool.
  The return type changed from void to gboolean in version 2.2.0 of Gtk.

older entries:

* Compilation falls over on FreeBSD when c2hs reads the type modifier
  __signed. I don't know if this is supposed to be replaced by cpp, for
  the time being I've just added -D__signed=signed.. There probably should
  be a autoconf test for this (and understanding of what's going on).

* Check all the files for additional functionality since 1.3.3.

* Add documentation support.

* Create automatic support for recursive make as it is done with applications
  and libraries. The Makefiles should be able to only specify three variables:
  TOOLMAKEDIRS (applications that are needed to build the libraries but which
  are not installed), LIBMAKEDIRS (the libraries that should be done next)
  and APPMAKEDIRS (which are applications which depend on the libraries). We
  need these three variables to get the sequence of inplace/noinplace right.
  Question: How do we reverse a list of words with make?
