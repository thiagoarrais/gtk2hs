TODO for gtk2hs

6/5/2005 Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* Image: bind the various get/set functions and sort out the NULL
	issues in terms of the API.

12/4/2005 Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* make sure the GList issue in all these radio button modules is ok.

3/4/2005 Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* textViewGetWindowType: the comment is not true. There is no
	DrawWindow member of the event (or rather we don't marshal it)

2/4/2005 Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* menuAttachToWidget, menuDetach should probably not be bound. Check this.

	* FileChooser & FileSelector: figure out the Glib file name encoding
	issue. What charset conversion should we do?

24/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>
	
	* check the ref counting of BOXED obects in signal callbacks, eg Event

23/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* change gconf so it does not require -fallow-overlapping-instances

12/3/2005  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	* glib timeouts and idle handlers:
	move them to glib package but re-export from gtk package
	make a newtype for priorities and add more of them
	make the IO Bool arg be the last arg so you can say:
	idleAdd priorityDefault $ do
	  ...

	add new menu toolbar API

	* there sould be a rule to rebuild .chi files even if the corresponding
	.hs file still exists. Otherwise the build can stick and you have to
	delete the .hs file to unstick it. Each .chs file should depend on the
	.hs file and (or perhaps instead of) the .chi file.

24/10/2004 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ac.uk>
	* Hierarchy.chs: c2hs 0.13.1 produces a with<Object> functions for
	every newtype definition. Import withForeignPtr for this.

28/07/2004  Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>

	GtkPlug new stuff in gtk 2.2
		gtk_plug_construct_for_display (maybe)
		gtk_plug_new_for_display

21/01/2003 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

* treeList/TreeStore.chs and treeList/ListStore.chs now use the preprocessor.
  The local c2hs is now able to run the preprocessor on those files that
  specify it in a pragma. An external c2hs would need to get preprocessed
  input. This has to be done in mk/library.mk .
