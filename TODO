TODO for gtk2hs

* The version-check makro in configure.in does not seem to work on Solaris.

* ghc on Solaris cannot generate dynamic callbacks with more than 4 
  (3 actually) parameters. Either complain or cpp-out all these
  connect functions.

* Compilation falls over on FreeBSD when c2hs reads the type modifier
  __signed. I don't know if this is supposed to be replaced by cpp, for
  the time being I've just added -D__signed=signed.. There probably should
  be a autoconf test for this (and understanding of what's going on).

* Figure out why ghc-pkg cannot install a package into localpackage.conf
  when there are dependencies into GHC package.conf. The gtk2 package
  depends on lang.

* Add a makefile target to produce a tarball.

* TextView is only half done.

* Check all the files for additional functionality since 1.3.3.
