-- | Get a file descriptor-based notificator for cancellation. When
--   cancellation receives a cancellation request, a character will be
--   made available on the returned file descriptor for input.
--   
--   This is very useful for detecting cancellation during I\/O
--   operations: you can use the select() call to check for available
--   input\/output on the file you are reading\/writing, and on the
--   notificator's file descriptor at the same time. If a data is
--   available on the notificator's file descriptor, you know you have
--   to cancel the read\/write operation.
