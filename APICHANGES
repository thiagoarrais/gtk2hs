# this file is for recording API changes that may affect users

after 0.9.10

renamed all the Event record member names

after 0.9.7

idle priorities now have right names. See eg progrss demo for how to change the code.

treeViewSetHadjustment, treeViewSetHadjustment,
treeViewSetHadjustment, treeViewSetHadjustment  all renamed and the set ones
	have arguments swapped

Enums.chs.pp: removed the WheelDown, WheelUp, OtherButton constructors from
the Button data type. These are never emitted. This could be potentially
bad if there is an X server out there that recognizes the 4th and 5th
button but doesn't turn them into scroll events. Furthermore, this data
type will break if X servers should ever support more than 5 buttons.

Events.hsc: removed several constructors, change the Key event.

General.chs: changed the priorty constants

Bin.chs: make binGetChild return Maybe

Paned.chs.pp: make panedGetChild(1|2) return Maybe

TextBuffer.chs.pp: swap order of args for textBufferGetIterAtLine so it
	follows the normal convention

Frame.chs: make frame(Get|Set)LabelAlign get and set the Y align as well as the
	X alignment.

TreeView.chs.pp: swap order of args for treeViewExpandRow so it follows the
	normal convention

ComboBox.chs.pp: have comboBoxSetModel take a Maybe parameter so it is possible
	to unset the model
