2003-11-17 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* tools/hierarchyGen/TypeGen.hs: Make parser accept both "if" and
	"as" statements.

	* sourceview/sourceview.h: Added the gtksourceviewmarker.h to the
	include file list.

	* hierarchyGen/hierarchy.list: Added SourceviewMarker.

2003-11-16 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, INSTALL: Documentation updates. In particular, the
	user has to do a make and then a make install.
	
	* configure.in: Force Unix library names when using ghc <6.0.

	* c2hs/C/CParser.hs: Fix the parsing of __attribute__, necessary
	for Windows.

	* mk/library.mk: Uncomment the path mangeling. On Windows this
	is still mandatory as /d/ has to be turned into d:/ when generating
	package.conf files.

	* mk/config.in, mk/library.mk, install-sh: Make sure the package
	installs if the local install-sh script is used. Added different
	variables for the install command, depending on what is installed.
	Updated install-sh with a newer version.
	
	* gtk/layout/Notebook.chs: The function notebookGetNPages does not
	exist in Gtk 2.0. Do not bind it in this case.
	
2003-11-15 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* INSTALL: Add instructions for Windows.
	
	* Makefile: Only build Sourceview if ENABLE_SOURCEVIEW is set.
	
	* mk/recurse.mk: Add a distclean goal that removes the
	localpackage.conf file. Make the build stop if there is an error
	in one of the subdirectories.

	* gtk/treeView/TreeSelection.chs: Remove a deprecated warning.
	
	* configure.in: Closed a case expression. Simplified and corrected
	the search for XML catalog files.

	* gtk/Makefile, sourceview/Makefile: Make them use the tools in
	tools/callbackGen and tools/hierarchyGen.
	
	* tools/typehier, tools/signals, tools/hierarchyGen,
	tools/callbackGen: Moved this files to a different
	directory. Reason: Everytime I remove the two directories typehier
	and signals from gtk/, CVS removes them from tools.
	
	* tools/typehier/TypeGen.hs: Renamed file to sort out CVS problem.

2003-11-11  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* demo/sourceview: New directory for import of sourceview demo
	program by Duncan Coutts <duncan.coutts@worcester.oxford.ac.uk>.

	* demo/sourceview/haskell.lang: New file giving haskell
	highlighting syntax for gtksourceview.

	* demo/sourceview/SourceViewTest.hs: New file to demonstrate
	sourceview.

	* demo/sourceview/Makefile: New file.
	
	* sourceview/SourceTag.chs (sourceTagSetStyle): Fix docu typo.

	* sourceview/Makefile (EXTRA_HFILES): Use relative path.
	(EXTRA_TARFILES): Not needed.
	(EXTRA_CPPFLAGS): Use SOURCEVIEW_CFLAGS instead.
	(EXTRA_LIBS): Use SOURCEVIEW_LIBS instead.

	* mk/recurse.mk (all): Add MAKE_DOCS.
	(inplace): Ditto.
	(noinplace): Ditto.
	(tarsource): Ditto.
	(clean): Ditto.

	* mk/library.mk	(installdirs): Reorder directories.

	* mk/config.mk.in (SOURCEVIEW_LIBS): Define.
	(SOURCEVIEW_CFLAGS): Ditto.

	* mk/common.mk: Fixes so that per package INSTALLDIR works:
	(INSTALLDIROK): Is now a deferred variable.
	(INST_*): Not passed through SEDPIPE for now.

	* gtk2hs.spec.in (%build): Instead of "--with c2hs" rpmbuild
	option, if %c2hs defined then pass it with --with-c2hs= to
	configure.
	(%install): Install sourceview haskell.lang file.  Clean demo
	to prevent binary files in doc dir.

	* configure.in: Only use GTK for gtk2 package check.  Use GTKGLEXT
	for gtkglext and SOURCEVIEW for gtksourceview, so that sourceview
	cflags and link options do not appear in ghc gtk2 package.  Drop
	unused PIXBUF config vars from GTK config vars.  Process
	SOURCEVIEW config vars in the same way as GTK ones.
	Search for specific external c2hs in PATH, like c2hs is searched
	with --with-c2hs=yes.  Treat "c2hs-gtk2hs" as a exceptional external
	c2hs which supports multiple chs files, allowing one to avoid
	building the internal c2hs on every clean build.

	* Makefile (MAKE_TOOLS): Only add c2hs when BUILT_IN_C2HS is no.
	(MAKE_DOCS): gendoc and doc targets moved here from MAKE_TOOLS since
	doc must be done after gtk.
	(MAKE_APPS): Add demo/sourceview.
	(dist): Depend on gtk2hs.spec.
	(rpm): dist now depends on gtk2hs.spec.
	(srpm): Ditto.
	Include Makefile.local if present for local build configuration.

2003-11-07 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* tools/signals/HookGenerator.hs, tools/signals/Makefile,
	tools/signals/Signal.chs-boot1, tools/signals/Signal.chs-boot2,
	tools/signals/gtkmarshal.list, tools/typehier/Makefile,
	tools/typehier/hierarchy.list: Dah. Removed the wrong files in the
	last commit. Resurrect the right ones.

2003-11-07 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>
	* tools/typehier/TypeGenerator.hs: Correct typo that caused
	Hierarchy.chs to include itself.

	* gtk/Makefile: Use the signal and type hierarchy generators in
	tools/.

	* gtk/typehier, gtk/signals: Remove the stale files.
	
2003-11-04  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* mk/config.mk.in (COMMONINSTALLDIR): Define default base package
	directory name.

	* mk/library.mk (INSTALLDIR): Define default package install dir to
	be under COMMONINSTALLDIR.

	* gtk/Makefile (INSTALLDIR): Drop local definition and use default.

	* mogul/Makefile (INSTALLDIR): Ditto.
	
	* sourceview/Makefile (INSTALLDIR): Ditto.

2003-11-03  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk2hs.spec.in (BuildRequires): Require gtksourceview-devel.
	(Requires): Require gtksourceview.
	(%post): Install sourceview package.
	(%preun): Remove sourceview package.

	* mk/recurse.mk (install-without-pkg): New target.

	* mk/application.mk ($(TARGETOK)): Depend on inplaceinit to make
	sure required localpackage.conf file exists.
	(install-without-pkg): Alias to install.

	* c2hs/c/CLexer.hs (linedir): Fix parsing for latest cpp #line
	extensions. [upstream patch from Manuel M T Chakravarty]

	* Makefile (EXTRA_TARFILES): Add mk/recurse.mk.

2003-10-02 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* mk/common.mk: Change comments for "targets" help output.

	* sourceview/Makefile: Corrected header file declaration (unused
	at the moment). 

	* gtk/glib/GList.chs: Added methods to marshal from GLists and
	GSLists.
	
	* sourceview/SourceLanguagesManager.chs, sourceview/SourceTag.chs,
	sourceview/SourceTagTable.chs: Added 
	
2003-10-26 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* Makefile, mk/recurse.mk, mk/common.mk: Turn the top-level
	Makefile into a bunch of variable declaration and put the real
	work into mk/recurse.mk. There are three main directories: tools
	which are built first and never installed, libraries which are
	built after the tools installed and registered with ghc and
	applications which are built last and installed.

	* demo/sourceview/Makefile, demo/sourceview/SourceViewTest.hs,
	demo/sourceview/haskell.lang: Added the example for the SourceView
	binding.

	* sourceview/Makefile, sourceview/SourceBuffer.chs,
	SourceLanguagesManager.chs, sourceview/SourceView.chs,
	sourceview/SourceStyleScheme.chs, sourceview/SourceTag.chs,
	sourceview/SourceTagStyle.hsc, sourceview/SourceTagTable.chs: New
	files and patches from Duncan.
	
2003-10-21 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* sourceview/Makefile, sourceview/SourceBuffer.chs,
	sourceview/SourceLanguage.chs,
	sourceview/SourceLanguagesManager.chs, sourceview/SourceView.chs,
	AUTHORS: Added the GtkSourceView widget contributed by Duncan
	Coutts.
	
	* mk/common.mk: Avoid message about several rules for the
	top-level file which are .chs files. This happend since the
	top-level file SourceView.chs is not removed form a list
	containing ./SourceView.chs which is what the wild-card searching
	gives. Solved by stripping the ./ prefix.
	
	* gtk/Makefile, tools/signals/HookGenerator.hs,
	tools/signals/Makefile, tools/signals/Signal.chs-boot1,
	tools/signals/Signal.chs-boot2, tools/signals/gtkmarshal.list,
	tools/typehier/Makefile, tools/typehier/TypeGenerator.hs,
	tools/typehier/hierarchy.list: Moved these file to a new directory
	tools/. The reason for this is that parts of the type hierarchy
	may only be generated if a specific widget is built, in this case
	it's GtkSourceview.
	
	* gtk/multiline/TextBuffer.chs: Use TextBufferClass tb => tb
	instead of TextBuffer as type for the Textbuffer.
	
	* gtk/abstract/Container.chs, gtk/multiline/TextIter.chs: Fix
	warning about deprecated FFI construct for GHC 6.0.

2003-08-09  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk/multiline/TextView.chs (textViewGetVisibleRect): Fix docu typo.

2003-08-02  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk/multiline/TextBuffer.chs (textBufferGetCharCount): Call
	text_buffer_get_char_count not text_buffer_get_line_count.

2003-07-31  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk2hs.spec.in: Default to ghc-6.0.1.
	(%files): Include demo as dir in docs rather than individual
	source files.

	* Makefile (inplace): Do not build the demos by default.
	(noinplace): Ditto.
	(demo): New separate target to build demos.
	(install*): Drop no-op for demos.
	(uninstall): Ditto.

2003-07-18 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* VERSION: Bumped to 0.9.4, prepare to do a ghc-6.0 release.
	
	* mk/common.mk: Make hsc2hs pass -no-hs-main to ghc when linking.
	This avoids an undefined symbol error for the Haskell main
	function on Apple and Solaris.

	* gtk/Makefile: Added the header file for gdk-pixbuf.

2003-07-15  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* mk/library.mk (install-without-pkg): New target that installs
	library without installing ghc package.
	(install): Use it.

	* gtk2hs.spec.in: Default to ghc-6.0 now.  Split binary package
	into -ghc%{ghc_version} and -doc subpackages.  Disable building of
	debuginfo subpackage.
	(%install): Use install-without-pkg.
	(%preun): Only remove object files when uninstalling.

	* Makefile (install-without-pkg): New target; like install but it
	does not install the ghc library packages.

2003-07-13 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/misc/Arrow.chs, gtk/general/Gtk.hs: Changed the name of the
	file to GArrow.chs to avoid the clash with Arrow in hslibs of GHC.

	* mk/library.mk: Remove the target install from install-pkg and
	add the target install-pkg to install. Without this, the files are
	copied but the package file is not updated.

	* gtk/signals/HookGenerator.hs.in: Removed this file which should
	have happened a long time ago. HookGenerator.hs is the only file
	needed.
	
2003-07-09 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>
	
	* c2hs/gen/GBMonad.hs, c2hs/gen/GenBind.hs: Applied the patch I
	wrote for c2hs 0.11.5 which created code for ForeignPtrs which is
	compatible with the new FFI of GHC 6.0.

	* abstract/Box.chs, abstract/Container.chs, abstract/Misc.chs,
	abstract/Object.chs, abstract/Paned.chs, abstract/Range.chs,
	abstract/Scale.chs, abstract/Scrollbar.hs, abstract/Separator.hs,

	treeList/TreeView.chs, treeList/TreeViewColumn.chs,
	typehier/TypeGenerator.hs, windows/Dialog.chs,
	windows/FileSel.chs, windows/Window.chs: Make compile with GHC
	6.00. There are two major changes in the FFI which made me
	separate everything that has to do with Foreign and Foreign.C into
	a new file called general/FFI.hs. The file UTFCForeign.hs is now
	obsolete as its string conversion functions are now in FFI.hs. The
	nullForeignPtr function is also located here. All files now import
	FFI instead of Foreign and UTFCForeign. The major changes are:
	newForeignPtr now takes a pointer to a C function as
	finalizer. Every destructor function is now defined differently
	depending on whether the new GHC is used or not. In particular
	there is now a function called free :: Ptr a -> IO () imported
	from the Foreign library. In addition to that I defined a function
	foreignFree which can be used as finalizer to a C data
	structure. It is equivalent to free if GHC version <=5.04 is
	used. The second change is that ForeignPtr are no longer accepted
	as arguments to foreign calls. This change is mainly reflected in
	c2hs, but also in some files which directly called functions.
	
2003-07-04 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* configure.in mk/config.mk.in mk/library.mk: Turned the
	--list-packages into a parameter which is determined by
	configure. The reason is that ghc 6 has a new semantic for
	ghc-pkg's --list-packages option.
	
2003-07-03  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* mogul/Makefile (INSTALLDIR): Set to mogul, so that mogul gets
	installed in its own subdir.

	* gtk/layout/Notebook.chs (notebookGetNPages): New function.
	Export it.

	* gtk/general/Gtk.hs: Import and re-export Gdk.

	* gtk/gdk/Gdk.chs: New module for gdk.h.  Currently just provides beep.

	* gtk/gdk/Drawable.chs (drawPixbuf): Doc fix: s/arg src/arg pb/.

	* gtk/Makefile: Define Pixbuf-HEADER and Gdk-HEADER.

	* gtk2hs.spec.in (Requires): Require ghc5.  Post and preun require
	ghc-pkg.
	(build): Configure --with-hc.
	(preun): Ignore package removal errors.

	* configure.in: --with-hc no longer requires a full-path, when
	requested compiler is in path.  When looking for HOpenGL pass "-l"
	to ghc-pkg, since "--list-packages" confuses ghc-pkg-6.0 built
	with ghc5.

	* VERSION: Bump version to 0.9.3.50.

	* Makefile (dist): LN already includes the "-s" option.

2003-05-23  Jens Petersen  <petersen@redhat.com>

	* gendoc/XMLwrite.hs (makeSymDescr): Move colspecs inside the
	tgroup.

	* doc/Makefile (html%): Make xsltproc write output directly to
	subdirectory.  Create the directory first if necessary.
	(fo%): Ditto.
	(clean): Remove reference xml files.

	* gtk2hs.spec.in (build): Pass docbook catalog and html xsl to
	configure and build html docs.
	(post): Give "-g" option to ghc-pkg to have ghci object files
	generated.
	(preun): Always remove any old ghci object files.
	(files): Include gtk and mogul docs in doc dir.
	
	* Makefile (EXTRA_TARFILES): Include gtk2hs.spec after all.

2003-05-22 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs: Changed the return type of the
	onTestCollapseRow and onTestExpandRow signals. Patch submitted by
	Duncan Coutts <duncan@coutts.uklinux.net>.
	
2003-05-19 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, mk/config.mk.in: Changed SGML_CATALOG_FILES to
	XML_CATALOG_FILES.

	* gtk/general/Gtk.hs: removed the hiding clause from Image. Don't
	know why it was there in the first place.
	
2003-05-18  Jens Petersen  <petersen@redhat.com>

	* gtk/pango/PangoLayout.chs (layoutIterGetLineExtents): Keep last
	doc ref on one line.
	(layoutCopy): Fix doc typo in data ref.

	* gtk/general/StockItems.hsc: s/method stockAdd/method stockAddItem/.

	* doc/mogul.xml: Docbook 4.2.

2003-05-17 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/gdk/Pixbuf.chs: Fixed documentation on creating inline pictures.

2003-05-17 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	0.9.3 release.

	* c2hs/base/syntax/Lexer.hs: There is a bug in either c2hs or the
	compiler when parsing the header files on PowerPC. I added a line
	which stops c2hs from panicing without understanding what is going
	on.

	* gendoc/Lexer.hs, gendoc/Update.hs, gendoc/XMLwrite.hs: Improved
	the documentation. It's still very rudimentary but might be
	useful.

	* gtk/gdk/Pixbuf.chs, gtk/general/Structs.hsc: Documentation fixes.
	
2003-05-16 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* AUTHORS: Add Vincenzo.

	* gtk/Makefile, gtk/gdk/Drawable.chs, gtk/gdk/GdkEnums.chs,
	gtk/general/Gtk.hs, gtk/general/Structs.hsc, gtk/gdk/Pixbuf.chs,
	configure.in, mk/config.mk.in: Add a good share of the pixbuf
	functions. Realize that the pixbuf library is always available
	when Gtk is installed, thus removed its detection from the
	configure script.

	* gtk/general/Style.chs: Add some more elements.

	* doc/Makefile: Remove -net. Oddly enough the whole translation
	process falls over if the DTD cannot be found. Worse xsltproc
	cannot read the CATALOG file, it seems to expect something in XML.

	* doc/gtk2hs.xml: Require Docbook 4.2.

	* gendoc/Abstract.hs, gendoc/Lexer.hs, gendoc/Parser.hs,
	gendoc/State.hs, gendoc/Update.hs, gendoc/XMLwrite.hs: Fixed
	layout and parser bugs, started to print data types.

	* gtk/gdk/Pixbuf.chs, gtk/general/StockItems.hsc,
	gtk/general/Structs.hsc, gtk/general/Style.chs,
	gtk/pango/PangoTypes.chs, gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs: Fixed
	documentation bugs.
	
2003-05-16  Jens Petersen  <petersen@redhat.com>

	* doc/Makefile (html%): Just write dependency as reference%.xml.
	(fo%): Ditto.

	* Makefile (EXTRA_TARFILES): Exclude spec file after all.
	(dist): Don't depend on spec file.
	(rpm): Depend on spec file.  Build from it and not the tarball.
	(srpm): Ditto.
	(gtk2hs.spec): Depend on VERSION.

	* mk/library.mk: Introduce DESTDIR variable for installing into a
	staging area or buildroot.
	(installdirs): Prefix dirs with DESTDIR.
	(installfiles): Prefix DESTDIR to destinations.
	(uninstallfiles): Add DESTDIR here too for good measure.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs: Documentation formatting fixes.

	* gtk/pango/PangoLayout.chs (layoutSetWidth): Fix doc typo.

	* gtk/general/Structs.hsc: Documentation fixes: s/@con/@constructor/.

	* doc/Makefile (html%): Only depend on the xml file for the target
	to be transformed.

	* gtk2hs.spec.in (Release): Append date for snapshot packages.
	(install): Use DESTDIR.
	(post): Hence no longer need to filter out buildroot prefix from
	pkg config files.
	(preun): Only remove ghc pkg configs when removing rpm package.

	* Makefile (dist): Add spec file as dependency.
	(rpm): Depend on dist target not tarball.
	(srpm): Ditto.
	(gtk2hs.spec): Target to generate spec file.

2003-05-10  Jens Petersen  <petersen@redhat.com>

	* mk/library.mk (install): Weaken to an install suitable for
	packaging in a buildroot, ie do not install the package config
	file into the buildroot.
	(installfiles): Install package config file too.
	(installpackage): Rename to "$(PACKAGENAME).conf".  Write pkg config
	to target, rather than installing directly in compiler's packages
	list.
	(install-pkg): New target.  Installs pkg config file into
	compiler's packages list.
	(uninstall): New target.  Unstalls files and removes package from
	compiler's packages list.
	($(TARGETOK)): Remove $(PACKAGENAME).conf so that it will be
	regenerated.

2003-05-09 Axel Simon <A.Simon@kent.ukc.ac.uk>

	* mk/common.mk: Run hsc2hs only with the libraries in CFLAGS not
	with other optimization/debugging options happening to be in
	there.

2003-05-08  Jens Petersen  <petersen@redhat.com>

	* gtk/treeList/TreeSelection.chs (onChanged): Renamed
	to onSelectionChanged since it conflicted with TextBuffer export.
	(afterChanged): Ditto to afterSelectionChanged.

	* gtk/multiline/TextBuffer.chs: Export all the signal event
	handling functions: onApplyTag, afterApplyTag, onBeginUserAction,
	afterBeginUserAction, onBufferChanged, afterBufferChanged,
	onDeleteRange, afterDeleteRange, onEndUserAction,
	afterEndUserAction, onInsertPixbuf, afterInsertPixbuf,
	onInsertText, afterInsertText, onMarkDeleted, afterMarkDeleted,
	onMarkSet, afterMarkSet, onModifiedChanged, afterModifiedChanged,
	onRemoveTag, afterRemoveTag.
	Rename onChanged and afterChanged to onBufferChanged and
	afterBufferChanged respectively.

	* gtk2hs.spec.in: Use ghc 5.04.3.
	Move perl buildroot prefix cleaning of package conf files into
	post-install script.

	* Makefile (EXTRA_TARFILES): Add gtk2hs.spec.in and gtk2hs.spec.
	(dist): Remove dist dir recursively.
	(rpm): New target.
	(srpm): Ditto.

	* AUTHORS: Update.

2003-05-15  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, mk/config.mk.in: Improved detection of OpenGl and
	GLExt.

	* mk/common.mk, mk/library.mk: Remove stale .hs files when c2hs
	fails.
	
2003-03-24  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* demo/concurrent/Progress.hs, demo/graphic/Drawing.hs
	demo/treeList/ListTest.hs, demo/unicode/Arabic.hs,
	gtk/general/StockItems.hsc: the stockButton... constants have
	gone, updated the demos.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs: Removed a type error when compiling
	with Gtk 2.2.

	* gtk/Makefile: Add GObject to the needed CHI files.
	
2003-03-24  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/general/Style.chs: Forgot to add this file.

	* gtk/general/StockItems.hsc, gtk/glib/GList.chs,
	gtk/menuComboToolbar/Toolbar.chs: Completed the list of stock
	items. Removed bugs in GList module. Changed name of stockAdd to
	stockAddItem due to clash with the constant stockAdd. Renamed
	stockLookup to stockLookupItem for symmetry. Had to change Toolbar
	for this to work.
	
2003-03-21  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/gdk/Events.hsc: Forgot to export enumerations from GdkEnum

	* gtk/Makefile: Add Pango HEADER definitions. Change the location
	of wingtk.h when creating a TAR ball. Add an explanation on how
	the HEADER definitions work.

	* demo/treeList/ListTest.hs: Added a callback that says onto which
	cell the user right-clicks.

	* demo/concurrent/Progress.hs: Imported Struct. Should sort out
	the module imports in Gtk.hs.

	* Makefile: add the concurrent demo.

	* VERSION: Bump to 0.9.3 in expectation of a new release.
	
2003-03-20  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* mk/common.mk: Removed ./ and blah/.. in file names when creating
	tar balls.

2003-03-10  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/signals/Signal.chs-boot2, gtk/general/Gtk.hs: Added a
	function to disconnect a signal.

	* mogul/TreeList.hs, mogul/Mogul.hs: Added changed the TreePath
	from Gtk to Mogul style. Patch by Duncan Coutts.
	
2003-03-08  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/abstract/Widget.chs, gtk/general/Enums.chs,
	gtk/general/Gtk.hs, gtk/general/Structs.hsc,
	gtk/treeList/TreeModel.chs, gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs: Completed
	TreeView.chs with the exception of DND support.

2003-02-27  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* demo/concurrent/Progress.hs demo/concurrent/Makefile: Added an
	example how concurrent Haskell threads can be run even if Gtk's
	main loop is running.

	* gtk/general/General.chs: Exported the three different priorities
	for idle handlers from Struct.hsc.
	
2003-02-10  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* demo/graphic/Drawing.hs gtk/gdk/Drawable.chs
	gtk/pango/PangoLayout.chsgtk/typehier/hierarchy.list
	gtk/pango/PangoTypes.chs: Completed PangoLayout as far as possible.
	Make the Drawing demo display some text.

2003-02-09  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/abstract/Widget.chs gtk/general/Gtk.hs
	gtk/general/Structs.hsc gtk/glib/GList.chs gtk/pango/Markup.hs
	gtk/pango/Rendering.chs gtk/pango/PangoLayout.chs: Started on the
	layout functions of Pango to draw text.
	
2003-02-07  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* mk/config.mk.in: added the variable CC so that the C compiler
	can be overridden with CC=blah ./configure

	* configure.in: don't call SUBST on GTK_CFLAGS and GTK_LIBS since
	it's done by the GTK macros earlier

2003-01-22  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gendoc/Makefile: forgot to add this file.
	
2003-01-21  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/wingtk.h: This file is needed for building on Windows. It
	disables a check of gtk_init_check to see whether the header has
	been compiled with Microsoft bitfields (which is true for hsc2hs
	where we mangle structure but false for c2hs where we call this
	function.)
	
	* gtk/Makefile: Inadvertently put hierarchy.list on the list of
	files to be wiped with make clean. Removed that again.

	* aclocal.m4 configure.in acinclude.m4 mk/config.mk.in
	mk/library.mk mk/common.mk: Changed the configuration
	infrastructure. aclocal.m4 is created by running aclocal, thus
	shouldn't really be in CVS. The package specific macros are now
	correctly in include.m4. configure.in changed so that is has
	options for GLArea and GdkPixbuf which can now selectively be
	enabled (though there is no code yet). The Makefiles have two new
	flags called ENABLE_GLAREA and ENABLE_PIXBUF which are set to yes
	or no. Fixed a bug in mk/library.mk that generated a bogus
	subsystem argument to the linker.

	* c2hs/chs/CHS.hs: Change c2hs so that is recognizes an OPTIONS
	-cpp pragma like ghc's. If this pragma is specified the Haskell
	program is run through CPP before the hooks are expanded. This is
	necessary for some files where the API changed between Gtk version
	2.0 and 2.2.

	* gtk/embedding/Plug.chs gtk/embedding/Socket.chs
	gtk/embedding/Embedding.hsc: Resurrected their functionality under
	Unix. The Plug was moved from windows/ to embedding/ so it could
	be selectively compiled, i.e. the whole embedding directory is
	left out on Windows.
	
2003-01-20  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Corrected wrongly escaped hash sign which serves as
	a comment to sed.

2003-01-19  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, gtk/Makefile, gtk/general/Gtk.hs, mk/common.mk,
	mk/library.mk, mk/config.mk.in: Adapt the configuration system
	to work differently on Windows. Fixed some installation issues.

	* mogul/GetWidget.hs mogul/Mogul.hs, mogul/NewWidget.hs: As
	a temporary fix, I commented out the Plug and Socket modules. 

	* demo/graphic/Drawing.hs: make sure that main has type IO ().

	* Makefile, doc/Makefile: Add docs to the tar ball.

	* gtk/typehier/TypeGenerator.hs, gtk/Makefile: Selectively create
	the types GtkPlug and GtkSocket, depending on whether we are
	compiling on Windows or not.

2003-01-18  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/windows/Plug.chs, gtk/embedding/Plug.chs: Moved this file
	to make compiling on Windows easier (omit embedding/ completely)

	* c2hs/c/CParser.hs: Fixed a parser bug for gcc extensions which
	became apparent when compiling on Windows (__dllexport).

	* gtk/general/Structs.hsc, gtk/embedding/Sockets.chs: Quick fix
	to compile on Windows. Declarations in Structs need to be moved
	to embedding/ so it is left out when compiling on Windows.

2003-01-11  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk/treeList/TreeStore.chs (treeStoreRemove): lift to Bool

	* gtk/treeList/ListStore.chs (listStoreRemove): lift to Bool

	* gtk/general/Structs.hsc (fromResponse): parenthesize
	ResponseUser i and add fromIntegral on rhs
	(toResponse): add fromIntegral for ResponseUser

	* demo/graphic/Drawing.hs (main): use ResponseOk

2003-01-10  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* configure.in: add gtk2hs.spec to output list

	* gtk2hs.spec.in: new file to generate a project rpm spec file

2003-01-10  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* demo/unicode/Arabic.hs (main): use ResponseYes, ResponseCancel
	and ResponseOk

	* gtk/windows/Dialog.chs: import and re-export ResponseId instead
	of responseName's.  import fromResponse and toResponse.
	(dialogRun): use toResponse
	(dialogResponse): use fromResponse
	(dialogAddButton): use fromResponse
	(dialogAddActionWidget): use fromResponse
	(dialogSetDefaultResponse): fromResponse
	(dialogSetResponseSensitive): fromResponse
	(onResponse, afterResponse): toResponse

	* gtk/general/Structs.hsc: export fromResponse and toResponse,
	instead of all the responseName's.  ResponseId is now a datatype.
	fromResponse converts from a ResponseId to the corresponding gtk
	constant values.  toResponse does the reverse map.  ResponseUser
	Int carries positive integer user defined responses.  fromResponse
	and toResponse are only defined for positive integers.

2002-12-19 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* VERSION, INSTALL: bump version, tweak instructions

	* doc/Makefile: create the subdirectories before copying

	* Makefile: make all also builds documentation, use proper names
	for the reference pages

	* gendoc/XMLwrite.hs: insert the name of the current node into
	each reference page.

	* gtk/menuComboToolbar/MenuBar.chs, gtk/abstract/Paned.chs: Docu
	fix, gave the widgets propper names.
	
2002-12-16 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gendoc/PrettyLib.hs: convert from PackedString to normal String

	* gendoc/Update.hs, gendoc/XMLwrite.hs: add hyperlinks between
	from synopsis and tried to link arguments to types.
	
	* doc/Makefile doc/gtk2hs.xml doc/mogul.xml: Added documentation.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeModel.chs: Added two functions and export the
	function gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string for
	CellRendererText.chs

	* gtk/treeList/CellRendererText.chs: use the bare function from
	TreeModel.chs to avoid converting the C string to Haskell and
	back.
	
	* configure.in: Changed the test for c2hs, so that it can cope with:
	"0.10.17 [compiled for GHC 5.04]", urk.

	* mk/comon.mk: repaired building with external c2hs, specifically,
	the -o : option is not understood by normal c2hs.

	* gtk/Makefile: added the -HEADER definition for all the files
	which where added since the last time someone compiled with
	external c2hs (most notably Region.chs, where the build falls
	over).
	
2002-12-10 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>
	
	* mk/config.mk.in, mk/library.mk: Separated out targets for
	installing packages and files. This is an attempt to simplify the
	creation of RPMs and Debian packages. Removed interactiveInstall
	for now since ghci still does not work with -package gtk2 or
	-package mogul.

2002-12-04 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* mk/library.mk: update the time of the copied library file so
	that it compiles on Darwin
	
2002-12-03 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* config.guess, config.sub: updated from GNU website

	* gtk/treelist/TreeModelSort.chs, gtk/gdk/DrawWindow.hs:
	  added, should have been there before!
	
2002-12-01 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* demo/graphic/Drawing.hs demo/hello/World.hs
	demo/treeList/ListTest.hs demo/unicode/Arabic.hs
	gtk/general/General.chs gtk/treeList/ListStore.chs
	mogul/WidgetTable.hs: Changed the initialization and the main loop
	function again.
	
2002-11-08 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/menuComboToolbar/Menu.chs gtk/treeList/ListStore.chs
	gtk/treeList/TreeModel.chs: Documentation changes.

2002-11-11 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gtk/general/General.chs: Changed the initialization and main
	loop functions. They now have names which do not clash with the
	Prelude.

	* Makefile: Include the two demos "graphics" and "treeList".

	* demo/graphic/Drawing.hs demo/hello/World.hs
	demo/treeList/ListTest.hs demo/unicode/Arabic.hs: Reflect the
	change to the main loop functions.
	
2002-11-08 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gendoc/Abstract.hs gendoc/Driver.hs gendoc/Lexer.hs
	gendoc/Parser.hs gendoc/State.hs gendoc/Update.hs
	gendoc/XMLwrite.hs gtk/abstract/Box.chs gtk/abstract/Range.chs

	gtk/multiline/TextView.chs gtk/pango/Markup.hs
	gtk/scrolling/ScrolledWindow.chs gtk/windows/Window.chs: More
	documentation fixes.

	* gtk/signals/gtkmarshal.list gtk/treeList/CellRenderer.hs
	gtk/treeList/CellRendererPixbuf.chs
	gtk/treeList/CellRendererText.chs
	gtk/treeList/CellRendererToggle.chs gtk/treeList/TreeModel.chs
	gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs gtk/treeList/TreeViewColumn.chs
	mogul/Mogul.hs mogul/TreeList.hs: Changed the internals of
	Attributes in CellRenderer. This now allows to set Just
	<something> for e.g. a color or the editable flag (for which both
	"editable" and "editable-set" have to be modified). Added the
	onEdited signal.
	
2002-11-04 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gtk/multiline/TextView.chs, general/Enums.chs, general/Gtk.hs:
	Completed TextView as far as possible.

	* gendoc/ XMLwrite.hs Abstract.hs Lexer.hs Parser.hs PrettyLib.hs:
	Switched to Olaf's Pretty Printing library. GHC's library seems to
	be broken (combinators are not associative). The right combinators
	still seem to be lacking.

	* general/Structs.hsc glib/GList.chs glib/GObject.chs
	glib/GType.chs glib/GValue.chs glib/GValueTypes.chs
	menuComboToolbar/Menu.chs misc/DrawingArea.chs misc/HandleBox.chs
	multiline/TextIter.chs typehier/TypeGenerator.hs
	windows/Dialog.chs: documentation fixes

	* mk/library.mk: i
	
2002-10-21  Jens Petersen  <petersen@haskell.org>

	* mogul/NewWidget.hs (newLayout): Take Maybe Adjustment's.

	* gtk/layout/Layout.chs: Import fromMaybe and nullForeignPtr.
	(layoutNew): Use them for Maybe Adjustment arguments.

	* gtk/abstract/Widget.chs (onGrabFocus, afterGrabFocus):
	Fix to use connect_NONE__NONE, since "grab_focus" event handler
	is just IO ().

2002-10-20 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gendoc/Abstract.hs XMLwrite.hs gtk2hs.xml: This version uses the
	unmodified version of Docbook. I'm still haveing trouble with the
	pretty-printer library (and with Docbook itself, of course).
	
2002-10-19 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gendoc/ Abstract.hs Driver.hs Lexer.hs Parser.hs State.hs
	Update.hs XMLwrite.hs gtk2hs.xml: Machinery to generate
	documentation from the comments in the binding. I just decided to
	use the original Docbook without any Haskell specific
	additions. So this first version tries to define and use a
	modified version of Docbook.
	
2002-10-06 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gtk/multiline/TextView.chs: Completed functionality and added
	all signals.

	* gtk/abstract/Container.chs gtk/display/Image.chs
	gtk/general/Gtk.hs gtk/general/Structs.hsc gtk/misc/Tooltips.chs
	gtk/multiline/TextBuffer.chs gtk/multiline/TextIter.chs
	gtk/multiline/TextView.chs gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs
	gtk/typehier/TypeGenerator.hs gtk/typehier/hierarchy.list 

	Added Files: gtk/gdk/Drawable.chs gtk/gdk/GC.chs gtk/gdk/Keys.chs

	Removed Files: gtk/gdk/GdkDrawable.chs gtk/gdk/GdkGC.chs
	gtk/gdk/GdkKeys.chs: Get rid of any Gdk prefix in types and module
	names.

2002-10-01 Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> 

	* gtk/gdk/GdkEnums.chs, gtk/general/Gtk.hs,
	gtk/general/Structs.hsc, gtk/Makefile, gtk/gdk/GdkGC.chs,
	gtk/gdk/GdkDrawable.chs,gtk/gdk/Region.chs,
	gtk/general/Structs.hsc, gtk/typehier/hierarchy.list,
	gtk/misc/DrawingArea.chs: Added the capabilities to do user
	specified widgets.

	* demo/graphic/Drawing.hs demo/graphic/Makefile Makefile: Added a
	demonstration of how to use the DrawingArea widget.
	
2002-08-20  Jonas Svensson <d99josve@dtek.chalmers.se>

        * gtk/abstract/Widget.chs: Added widgetSetSizeRequest function.

2002-08-15  Jonas Svensson <d99josve@dtek.chalmers.se>

        * gtk/menuComboToolbar/ImageMenuItem.chs: Changed type from
        Image to Widget on get/setImage functions. Changed getImage
        to return IO (Maybe Widget).

2002-08-13  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk> on behalf of 
	    Jonas Svensson <d99josve@dtek.chalmers.se>
	
        * gtk/Makefile: Added ImageMenuItem to list of moduels

        * gtk/typehier/hierarchy.list: Added GtkImageMenuItem
 
        * gtk/general/Gtk.hs: Now imports and exports ImageMenuItem

        * gtk/menuComboToolbar/ImageMenuItem.chs: Implementation of
          the GtkImageMenuItem widget.
	
2002-08-12  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>
	* gtk/multiline/TextView.chs: Added SetEditable, GetEditable,
	SetCursorVisible, GetCursorVisible which was a patch from Jonas
	Svensson <d99josve@dtek.chalmers.se>

2002-08-05  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/Makefile, mk/library.mk, mk/common.mk: Smaller fixed for the
	broken ghc-pkg of ghc version 5.04. ghci still doesn't work.

	* most .chs files in gtk/: Slight changes of documentation to make
	the documentation tools work (the latter are not yet in CVS).
	
2002-08-02  Jens Petersen <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk/windows/FileSel.chs: Re-export fileSelectionGetButtons.

	* gtk/general/Structs.hsc(fileSelectionGetButtons):  
	Like fileSelectionQueryButtons in gtk+hs.  Export it.

2002-07-23  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/treeList/TreeSelection.chs: Added the "changed"
	signal. Realized that there are many other modules without
	signals.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs(treeViewGetSelection),
	gtk/typehier/hierarchy.list: TreeSelection is only a GObject, so
	generate it with makeNewGObject.

2002-07-21  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/Makefile, mogul/Makefile, gtk/general/UTFCForeign.hs: Make
	the library compile with GHC 5.04 which introduces hierarchical
	modules.
	
	* gtk/general/General.chs(setLocale): remove

	* demo/unicode/Arabic.hs: remove setLocale
	
	* modul/WidgetTable.hs: Change the dependency on FiniteMap to a
	newly introduced impedance matcher module compat/LocalData.hs.
	
	* treeList/TreeSelection.chs, gdk/GdkKeys.chs, general/Stock.hsc,
	general/General.chs, signal/Signal.chs-boot2, gdk/Events.hsc,
	gdk/GdkEnums.hs, glib/GObject.hs, modul/WidgetTable.hs,
	mogule/TreeList.hs: Changed the dependency on IOExts to a newly
	introduced impedance matcher module compat/LocalData.hs.

	* treeList/StoreValue.hs: Changed the dependency on Exception to a
	newly introduced impedance matcher module compat/LocalControl.hs.

	* multiline/TextMark.chs, multiline/TextIter.chs,
	multiline/TextTag.chs, multiline/TextTagTable.chs,
	multiline/TextView.chs, gdk/GdkKeys.chs, gdk/Events.hsc,
	gtk/typehier/TypeGenerator.hs: Changed CForeign to UTFCForeign.

	* gtk/glib/GList.chs: remove CForeign import
	
	* configure.in: Corrected the search path when searching for a
	ghc-pkg which is not in the PATH. Remove all non-existant paths
	from GTK_CFLAGS and from GTK_LIBS.

	* mk/chsDepend.in: Removed the dependency .dep <- .chs to avoid
	that automatic generated .chs files are built when doing a "make
	distclean".

	* gtk/Makefile: Changed the dependency on "lang" to "base" for GHC
	versions with hierarchical module system.

	* window/FileSel.chs: Changed chi import to normal Haskell import.

	* mk/common.mk: "inplaceinit" is no longer prerequisite for "all"

	* mk/library.mk: "noinplace" is no longer prerequisite for
	"installcheck"

2002-07-19  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/windows/Window.chs: added deprecated windowSetPolicy method
	and found out that windowGetResizable and windowSetResizable were
	missing, so I added them as well.

	* mogul/TreeList.hs: fixed a bug in treeSkelAddAttribute

2002-07-18  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/treeList/CellRendererText.chs: changed the attribute types
	of foreground and background colors to Maybe String.

	* gtk/glib/GValue.chs: Changed the String member of the GValue
	union to Maybe String.

	* gtk/glib/GValueTypes.chs: Reflect the change in GValue when
	marshalling strings.

	* gtk/Makefile: TreeView needs TreeViewColumn.chi, so I added
	TreeViewColumn to the needed chi-files.

	* demo/treeList/ListTest.hs: Cell colors are now of type Maybe
	String. Remove the comments from the writeStore function.
	
2002-07-18  Jens Petersen <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk/gdk/GdkKeys.chs: Bind keyvalName and keyvalFromName.

	* gtk/windows/FileSel.chs: Binding based on file from gtk+hs.
	fileSelectionQueryButtons needs to be fixed for this to be useful.

	* mogul/TreeList.hs: Fix a couple of doc typos.

	* mogul/NewWidget.hs (newNamedScrolledWindow): Maybe take an 
	Adjustment.
	(newScrolledWindow): Ditto.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeViewColumn.chs (treeViewColumnNewWithAttributes): 
	Haskell implementation to avoid binding to original variad function.
	(treeViewColumnAddAttributes): New convenience function.
	(treeViewColumnSetAttributes): Haskell implementation to avoid
	binding to original variad function.
	(treeViewColumnClearAttributes): Add binding.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs (treeViewInsertColumnWithAttributes):
	Haskell implementation to avoid binding to original variad function.

	* gtk/scrolling/ScrolledWindow.chs (scrolledWindowNew): Make it
	maybe take Adjustments, passing a null ptr when Nothing is given.

	* gtk/general/Gtk.hs: Import and re-export GdkKeys and FileSel.

	* gtk/general/General.chs: Export timeoutAdd, timeoutRemove, idleAdd, 
	idleRemove and HandlerId.

	* gtk/entry/Entry.chs: Bind entryGetText.

	* gtk/Makefile: Add header vars for GdkKeys and FileSel.

2002-07-17 Jens Petersen <petersen@haskell.org>

	* Added .cvsignore files to most of the directories in the tree
	to give cleaner cvs updates from a build tree.

2002-07-08 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

        * Reinstantiated the TreeList.hs module in mogul/. Made up a new
        concept to make the TreeView widget easier to use. To create a
	TreeStore or ListStore object, the user now has to create a
	skeleton that holds different attributes. The skeleton can then
	be converted into a ListStore or TreeStore. This takes care of
	the fact that columns cannot be added to the store objects on
	the fly.

2002-06-22 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

	* Changed the configure script to more reliably find GNU versions
	of sed and grep. Improved the build system which now correctly
	manages dependencies between .chs file. Changed the calling
	convention of the functions such that the object is the first
	argument as in gtk+hs. Prepared for generating automatic
	documentation.

2002-04-16 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

	* Created the "dist" goal to tar a source distribution. Introduced
	a VERSION file.

2002-04-14 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

	* Incooperated c2hs version 0.10.12 into the source tree. Omitted
	  the lib/ directory. For the latter I had to change C2HSConfig.hs.in
	  to import "toBool" from MarshalUtils. The sources are otherwise
	  unchanged.

	* HookGenerator.hs: Added test for SPARC architecture. GHC is unable
	  to generate dynamic callbacks with more than 4 word worth of
	  arguments. By replacing all connectTo... functions which take more
	  than 3 arguments (real args and the GtkObject) with error stubs
	  this is only a temporary solution.
