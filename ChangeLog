	* gtk/windows/FileSel.chs: Re-export fileSelectionGetButtons.

	* gtk/general/Structs.hsc(fileSelectionGetButtons):  
	Like fileSelectionQueryButtons in gtk+hs.  Export it.

2002-07-23  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/treeList/TreeSelection.chs: Added the "changed"
	signal. Realized that there are many other modules without
	signals.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs(treeViewGetSelection),
	gtk/typehier/hierarchy.list: TreeSelection is only a GObject, so
	generate it with makeNewGObject.

2002-07-21  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/Makefile, mogul/Makefile, gtk/general/UTFCForeign.hs: Make
	the library compile with GHC 5.04 which introduces hierarchical
	modules.
	
	* gtk/general/General.chs(setLocale): remove

	* demo/unicode/Arabic.hs: remove setLocale
	
	* modul/WidgetTable.hs: Change the dependency on FiniteMap to a
	newly introduced impedance matcher module compat/LocalData.hs.
	
	* treeList/TreeSelection.chs, gdk/GdkKeys.chs, general/Stock.hsc,
	general/General.chs, signal/Signal.chs-boot2, gdk/Events.hsc,
	gdk/GdkEnums.hs, glib/GObject.hs, modul/WidgetTable.hs,
	mogule/TreeList.hs: Changed the dependency on IOExts to a newly
	introduced impedance matcher module compat/LocalData.hs.

	* treeList/StoreValue.hs: Changed the dependency on Exception to a
	newly introduced impedance matcher module compat/LocalControl.hs.

	* multiline/TextMark.chs, multiline/TextIter.chs,
	multiline/TextTag.chs, multiline/TextTagTable.chs,
	multiline/TextView.chs, gdk/GdkKeys.chs, gdk/Events.hsc,
	gtk/typehier/TypeGenerator.hs: Changed CForeign to UTFCForeign.

	* gtk/glib/GList.chs: remove CForeign import
	
	* configure.in: Corrected the search path when searching for a
	ghc-pkg which is not in the PATH. Remove all non-existant paths
	from GTK_CFLAGS and from GTK_LIBS.

	* mk/chsDepend.in: Removed the dependency .dep <- .chs to avoid
	that automatic generated .chs files are built when doing a "make
	distclean".

	* gtk/Makefile: Changed the dependency on "lang" to "base" for GHC
	versions with hierarchical module system.

	* window/FileSel.chs: Changed chi import to normal Haskell import.

	* mk/common.mk: "inplaceinit" is no longer prerequisite for "all"

	* mk/library.mk: "noinplace" is no longer prerequisite for
	"installcheck"

2002-07-19  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/windows/Window.chs: added deprecated windowSetPolicy method
	and found out that windowGetResizable and windowSetResizable were
	missing, so I added them as well.

	* mogul/TreeList.hs: fixed a bug in treeSkelAddAttribute

2002-07-18  Axel Simon <A.Simon@ukc.ac.uk>

	* gtk/treeList/CellRendererText.chs: changed the attribute types
	of foreground and background colors to Maybe String.

	* gtk/glib/GValue.chs: Changed the String member of the GValue
	union to Maybe String.

	* gtk/glib/GValueTypes.chs: Reflect the change in GValue when
	marshalling strings.

	* gtk/Makefile: TreeView needs TreeViewColumn.chi, so I added
	TreeViewColumn to the needed chi-files.

	* demo/treeList/ListTest.hs: Cell colors are now of type Maybe
	String. Remove the comments from the writeStore function.
	
2002-07-18  Jens Petersen <petersen@haskell.org>

	* gtk/gdk/GdkKeys.chs: Bind keyvalName and keyvalFromName.

	* gtk/windows/FileSel.chs: Binding based on file from gtk+hs.
	fileSelectionQueryButtons needs to be fixed for this to be useful.

	* mogul/TreeList.hs: Fix a couple of doc typos.

	* mogul/NewWidget.hs (newNamedScrolledWindow): Maybe take an 
	Adjustment.
	(newScrolledWindow): Ditto.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeViewColumn.chs (treeViewColumnNewWithAttributes): 
	Haskell implementation to avoid binding to original variad function.
	(treeViewColumnAddAttributes): New convenience function.
	(treeViewColumnSetAttributes): Haskell implementation to avoid
	binding to original variad function.
	(treeViewColumnClearAttributes): Add binding.

	* gtk/treeList/TreeView.chs (treeViewInsertColumnWithAttributes):
	Haskell implementation to avoid binding to original variad function.

	* gtk/scrolling/ScrolledWindow.chs (scrolledWindowNew): Make it
	maybe take Adjustments, passing a null ptr when Nothing is given.

	* gtk/general/Gtk.hs: Import and re-export GdkKeys and FileSel.

	* gtk/general/General.chs: Export timeoutAdd, timeoutRemove, idleAdd, 
	idleRemove and HandlerId.

	* gtk/entry/Entry.chs: Bind entryGetText.

	* gtk/Makefile: Add header vars for GdkKeys and FileSel.

2002-07-17 Jens Petersen <petersen@haskell.org>

	* Added .cvsignore files to most of the directories in the tree
	to give cleaner cvs updates from a build tree.

2002-07-08 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

        * Reinstantiated the TreeList.hs module in mogul/. Made up a new
        concept to make the TreeView widget easier to use. To create a
	TreeStore or ListStore object, the user now has to create a
	skeleton that holds different attributes. The skeleton can then
	be converted into a ListStore or TreeStore. This takes care of
	the fact that columns cannot be added to the store objects on
	the fly.

2002-06-22 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

	* Changed the configure script to more reliably find GNU versions
	of sed and grep. Improved the build system which now correctly
	manages dependencies between .chs file. Changed the calling
	convention of the functions such that the object is the first
	argument as in gtk+hs. Prepared for generating automatic
	documentation.

2002-04-16 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

	* Created the "dist" goal to tar a source distribution. Introduced
	a VERSION file.

2002-04-14 Axel Simon <as49@ukc.ac.uk>

	* Incooperated c2hs version 0.10.12 into the source tree. Omitted
	  the lib/ directory. For the latter I had to change C2HSConfig.hs.in
	  to import "toBool" from MarshalUtils. The sources are otherwise
	  unchanged.

	* HookGenerator.hs: Added test for SPARC architecture. GHC is unable
	  to generate dynamic callbacks with more than 4 word worth of
	  arguments. By replacing all connectTo... functions which take more
	  than 3 arguments (real args and the GtkObject) with error stubs
	  this is only a temporary solution.
