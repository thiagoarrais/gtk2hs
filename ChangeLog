	* Created the "dist" goal to tar a source distribution. Introduced
	  a VERSION file.

	* Incooperated c2hs version 0.10.12 into the source tree. Omitted
	  the lib/ directory. For the latter I had to change C2HSConfig.hs.in
	  to import "toBool" from MarshalUtils. The sources are otherwise
	  unchanged.

	* HookGenerator.hs: Added test for SPARC architecture. GHC is unable
	  to generate dynamic callbacks with more than 4 word worth of
	  arguments. By replacing all connectTo... functions which take more
	  than 3 arguments (real args and the GtkObject) with error stubs
	  this is only a temporary solution.
