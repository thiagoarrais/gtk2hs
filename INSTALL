gtk2hs: A binding of Gtk Version 2 for the programming language Haskell

This binding make functions from the following libraries available (thus,
these need to be installed):
 * glib-2.0.0.tar.bz2
 * atk-1.0.0.tar.bz2
 * pango-1.0.0.tar.bz2
 * gtk+-2.0.0.tar.bz2

Furthermore, a working c2hs, version 0.8.0 or greater, and the GHC Haskell
compiler, version 5.00 or greater, is required. If you have more than 250MB
of physical memory at disposal and c2hs version 0.10.12 or later, you should
specify --enable-ample-memory as an option to ./configure for a much quicker
compilation. To use the library with GHCi, you need GHC 5.03.0 or later. i
(The latter is untested.)

Note: c2hs will most likely fail to preprocess the header files. If this is
      the case change hipar/c2hs/toplevel/C2HSConfig.hs. Turn the line
cppopts  = ""
      into
cppopts  = "-x c"
      and do a make install at the hipar level.

After checking out the sources you say

~/gtk2hs:$ autoconf

and 

~/gtk2hs:$ ./configure

. You might call configure with --help first, to see which options it supports.
If you are using a globally installed ghc and have no priviliges to install
new packages, you now say

~/gtk2hs:$ make inplace

where make should be GNU make. This will create a file called localpackage.conf
in the current directory. To use it with your programs you need to specify
-package-conf ~/gtk2hs/localpackage.conf -package mogul
when building your programs. 

If you can have the priviliges to alter GHC's packages, do

~/gtk2hs:$ make install

and simply specify
-package mogul
from that moment on.

Good luck.
