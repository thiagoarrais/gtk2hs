--    The object system in the second version of GTK is based on GObject from
--    GLIB. This base class is rather primitive in that it only implements
--    ref and unref methods (and others that are not interesting to us). If
--    the marshall list mentions OBJECT it refers to an instance of this 
--    GObject which is automatically wrapped with a ref and unref call.
--    Structures which are not derived from GObject have to be passed as
--    BOXED which gives the signal connect function a possiblity to do the
--    conversion into a proper ForeignPtr type. In special cases the signal
--    connect function use a PTR type which will then be mangled in the
--    user function directly. The latter is needed if a signal delivers a
--    pointer to a string and its length in a separate integer.

-- | Block a specific signal handler.
--
-- * Blocks a handler of an instance so it will not be called during any
--   signal emissions unless it is unblocked again. Thus \"blocking\" a signal
--   handler means to temporarily deactive it, a signal handler has to be
--   unblocked exactly the same amount of times it has been blocked before
--   to become active again.

-- | Unblock a specific signal handler.
--
-- * Undoes the effect of a previous 'signalBlock' call. A blocked handler
--   is skipped during signal emissions and will not be invoked, unblocking
--   it (for exactly the amount of times it has been blocked before) reverts
--   its \"blocked\" state, so the handler will be recognized by the signal
--   system and is called upon future or currently ongoing signal emissions
--   (since the order in which handlers are called during signal emissions
--   is deterministic, whether the unblocked handler in question is called
--   as part of a currently ongoing emission depends on how far that
--   emission has proceeded yet).

-- | Stops a signal's current emission.
--
-- * This will prevent the default method from running. The sequence in which
--   handlers are run is \"first\", \"on\", \"last\" then \"after\" where
--   Gtk-internal
--   signals are connected either at \"first\" or at \"last\". Hence this
--   function can only stop the signal processing if it is called from within
--   a handler that is connected with an \"on\" signal and if the Gtk-internal
--   handler is connected as \"last\". Gtk prints a warning if this function
--   is used on a signal which isn't being emitted.
