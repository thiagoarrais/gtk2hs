The tools in this directory are to help investigate gtk2hs's coverage of the gtk
API. You should modify the Makefile to set which version of gtk you'd like to
check aginst. Running 'make' will then download the tarball from the gtk website
and extract the gtk.def file which contains a complete list of the exported gtk
functions.

It also scans all the files in the gtk directory for calls to gtk APIs. It
filters the list of gtk APIs to get rid of deprecated, internal or other
functions we don't care about.

So what you want to do is
$ make

to get a summary and then
$ diff gtk.def.filtered gtk.coverage

to get a list of what is currently implemented vs what is not.

If something should not be implemented you can exclude it from the list by
modifying the gtk.ignore file. You can also put api.ignore files in any
directory under gtk/ and they will be used too. For excluding individual
functions it's probably better to use a local api.ignore file, to stop the
main gtk.ignore file becoming unmanagebly large. The central one should be
for excluding entire sections of the gtk api and general stuff.

The syntax of these files is as follows:

 * empty lines or lines beginning with # are ignored

 * lines like:
 
exclude gtk_some_group_of_functions

   give an instruction to ignore functions with a name that matches the regex.

   Note that functions will be excluded if the regex matches any part of the
   function name, so saying 'gtk_text' will exclude all functions with that
   prefix. Standard posix regex syntax applies so you can use ^ and $ to
   anchor the regex if you need, eg '_get_type$' will only match things things
   ending in '_get_type'
   
 * lines like:

do not exclude gtk_some_function

   can be used where using 'exclude' has excluded too much and you need some
   exceptions. eg to exclude gtk_progress but not gtk_progress_box

 * finally:

always exclude _gtk_type$

   can be used where you really really want to exclude something even if a
   'do not exclude' would have caused it not to be excluded. This is mostly
   only useful for the above example and a couple similar ones.
