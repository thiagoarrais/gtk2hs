                       (maybe as PART of a full compiler)

The Compiler Toolkit is a support library for compilers in Haskell.  You may
have obtained it as part of a compiler using the library.  See also

Moreover, there may be additional subdirectories (as, for example, `c2hs' and
`nepal'), which contain compilers using the Compiler Toolkit.  Check the
README file and other accompanying documentation in these subdirectories for
details on any compilers that are contained in this package.

Whether or not you obtained the Compiler Toolkit in conjunction with a
compiler using the toolkit, the modules in `base' are a self-contained set of
compiler support modules whose use in other compilers is encouraged.
