--  Configuration options; largely set by `configure'.
--
--- TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -- programs and paths
  --
  cpp, cppopts, hpaths, dlsuffix, tmpdir,
  --
  -- system-dependent definitions, as the New FFI isn't fully supported on all
  -- systems yet
  --

import 
 Foreign (Ptr, FunPtr)  -- on an extra line to trick the stupid `mkdependHS'
import Foreign  (Storable(sizeOf, alignment), toBool)
import Foreign.C (CInt)

-- program settings
-- ----------------

-- C preprocessor executable (EXPORTED)
--
cpp :: FilePath
cpp  = _C2HS_CPP -- used to be: "@CPP@"

-- C preprocessor options (EXPORTED)
--
-- * `-x c' forces CPP to regard the input as C code; this option seems to be
--   understood at least on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris and seems to make a
--   difference over the default language setting on FreeBSD
--
-- * `-P' would suppress `#line' directives
--
cppopts :: String
cppopts  = "-x c"

-- standard system search paths for header files (EXPORTED)
--
hpaths :: [FilePath]
hpaths  = [".", "/usr/include", "/usr/local/include"]

-- OS-dependent suffix for dynamic libraries
--
dlsuffix :: String
dlsuffix  = error "C2HSConfig.dlsuffix" -- used to be: "@DLSUFFIX@"

-- possibly system-dependent location for temporary files
--
tmpdir :: String
tmpdir = error "C2HSConfig.tmpdir" -- used to be: "@TMPDIR@"
  -- tmpdir is unused and it causes problems on widows since it ends up with
  -- the value "C:\TMP" which is not a valid string. It'd need to be "C:\\TMP"
  -- so just remove the thing for now.

-- parameters of the targeted C compiler
-- -------------------------------------

-- indicates in which direction the C compiler fills bitfields (EXPORTED)
--
-- * the value is 1 or -1, depending on whether the direction is growing
--   towards the MSB
--
bitfieldDirection :: Int
bitfieldDirection  = fromIntegral bitfield_direction

foreign import ccall bitfield_direction :: CInt

-- indicates whether a bitfield that does not fit into a partially filled
-- storage unit in its entirety introduce padding or split over two storage
-- units (EXPORTED)
--
-- * `True' means that such a bitfield introduces padding (instead of being
--   split)
--
bitfieldPadding :: Bool
bitfieldPadding  = toBool bitfield_padding

foreign import ccall bitfield_padding :: CInt

-- indicates whether a bitfield of type `int' is signed in the targeted C
-- compiler (EXPORTED)
--
bitfieldIntSigned :: Bool
bitfieldIntSigned  = toBool bitfield_int_signed

foreign import ccall bitfield_int_signed :: CInt

-- the alignment constraint for a bitfield (EXPORTED)
--
-- * this makes the assumption that the alignment of a bitfield is independent
--   of the bitfield's size
--
bitfieldAlignment :: Int
bitfieldAlignment  = fromIntegral bitfield_alignment

foreign import ccall bitfield_alignment :: CInt
