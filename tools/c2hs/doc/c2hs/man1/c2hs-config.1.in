.SH NAME
c2hs-config \- script to get information about the C2HS marshalling library.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B c2hs-config
[\-\-c2hs]
[\-\-system=HS]
[\-\-version]
[\-\-libs]
[\-\-cflags]
[\-\-prefix[=\fIDIR\fP]]
[\-\-exec\-prefix[=\fIDIR\fP]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly describes the
.B c2hs-config 
command.  For more details, refer to the main documentation, which is
available in various other formats, including SGML and HTML; see below.
.PP

.SH OPTIONS
.B c2hs-config
accepts the following options:
.TP
.B  \-\-c2hs
Print the path to the \flc2hs-config\fR tool itself. This slightly
simplifies configuration management of libraries generated by C\->Haskell, as
it is sufficient to know the location of c2hs-config to access all other
components of C\->Haskell.
.TP
.BR \-\-system= HS
Select the target compilation system. Currently, only \fBghc4\fR is supported,
but this may change in future releases.
.TP
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fIC2HS\fP to the standard output.
.TP
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program against the
\fIC2HS\fP library.
.TP
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program using the
\fIC2HS\fP library.
.TP
.BI  \-\-prefix= DIR
If specified, use \fIDIR\fR instead of the installation directory that
\fIC\->Haskell\fP was built with when computing the output for the
\-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec directory
if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before
any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
.TP
.BI  \-\-exec\-prefix= DIR
If specified, use \fIDIR\fR instead of the installation exec directory that
\fIC2HS\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
