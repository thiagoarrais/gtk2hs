If you already have the Compiler Toolkit, unpack the C->Haskell sources over
the toolkit sources - if you got both in one tar file, this is already done.
Now go in the root directory of the Compiler Toolkit and follow the
installation instructions that you are finding there - from here, they should
be in `../INSTALL'.

If you do not have the Compiler Toolkit, grab it from

  http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/ctk/

Then, follow the above instructions.
