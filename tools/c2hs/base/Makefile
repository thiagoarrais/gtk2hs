#  Essentially, instantiates the generic definitions from `common.mk' and 
#  includes the Makefiles of all parts, such that cross-part dependencies still
#  allow to use the correct flags when calling the compiler.
#  The dependency information for this package is read from `.depend' if 
#  existent.
