--- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  This module provides system dependent routines for building with the
--  `posix' package from HSLibs.
--
--  The original definition of `runPiped' is courtesy of Sven Panne 
--  <Sven.Panne@informatik.uni-muenchen.de> as distributed on the 
--  glasgow-haskell-bugs@dcs.gla.ac.uk mailing list as
--  <3625B8D9.D6873372@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>.
--
--- DOCU ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  language: Haskell 98 (tested with the low-level interfaces of 
--	      GHC 4.0[2..8])
--
--  * may only import `Config'
--
--  * has to be compiled with `-syslib posix'
--
--  Provided Services
--  -----------------
--
--  * Process management:
--    - creation of child process connected with pipes
--
--- TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--

module SysDepPosix (
  ProcessID,		-- re-exported
  runPiped,
) where

import Directory  (setCurrentDirectory)
import IO	  (Handle, BufferMode(..), hSetBuffering) 

import Posix	 (forkProcess, executeFile,
		  Fd, createPipe, dupTo, fdClose,
		  intToFd, fdToHandle, ProcessID)


-- Process management
-- ------------------

-- run the given command in a child process whose stdin and stdout are
-- connected with pipes to the current processes (EXPORTED)
--
-- * the command is executed via a `/bin/sh -c' and receives the given
--   arguments and environment
-- * a working directory for the sub process may be specified
-- * the child's PID is returned together with a pipe from the child's stdout
--   and another pipe to the child's stdin
--
-- ATTENTION: At least if the sub-process is also a Haskell program, setting
--	      `LineBuffering' in the code below is not enough.  The
--	      sub-process also has to do that -- although, this seems
--	      necessary only for the direction from the sub-process to the
--	      parent.
--
--	      It is not clear if that is a bug in the following code (or the
--	      library code it uses) or the code of the sub-process.
