--- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  This module provide some information about the specific implementation of
--  C that we are dealing with.
--
--- DOCU ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  language: Haskell 98
--
--  Bit fields
--  ~~~~~~~~~~
--  Bit fields in C can be signed and unsigned.  According to K&R A8.3, they
--  can only be formed from `int', `signed int', and `unsigned int', where for
--  `int' it is implementation dependent whether the field is signed or
--  unsigned.  Moreover, the following parameters are implementation
--  dependent:
--
--  * the direction of packing bits into storage units,
--  * the size of storage units, and
--  * whether when a field that doesn't fit a partially filled storage unit
--    is split across units or the partially filled unit is padded.
--
--  Generally, unnamed fields (those without an identifier) with a width of 0
--  are guaranteed to forces the above padding.  Note that in `CPrimType' we
--  only represent 0 width fields *if* they imply padding.  In other words,
--  whenever they are unnamed, they are represented by a `CPrimType', and if
--  they are named, they are represented by a `CPrimType' only if that
--  targeted C compiler chooses to let them introduce padding.  If a field
--  does not have any effect, it is dropped during the conversion of a C type
--  into a `CPrimType'-based representation.
--
--  In the code, we assume that the alignment of a bitfield (as determined by
--  `bitfieldAlignment') is independent of the size of the bitfield.
--
--- TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------

module CInfo (
  CPrimType(..), size, alignment, 
  bitfieldDirection, bitfieldPadding, bitfieldIntSigned, bitfieldAlignment
) where 

import CForeign

-- we can't rely on the compiler used to compile c2hs already having the new
-- FFI, so this is system dependent
--
import C2HSConfig (Ptr, FunPtr, 
		   bitfieldDirection, bitfieldPadding, bitfieldIntSigned,
		   bitfieldAlignment)
import qualified  
       C2HSConfig as Storable

-- alignment constraint for a C bitfield
--
-- * gets the bitfield size (in bits) as an argument
--
-- * alignments constraints smaller or equal to zero are reserved for bitfield
--   alignments
--
-- * bitfields of size 0 always trigger padding; thus, they get the maximal
--   size
--
-- * if bitfields whose size exceeds the space that is still available in a
--   partially filled storage unit trigger padding, the size of a storage unit
--   is provided as the alignment constraint; otherwise, it is 0 (meaning it
--   definitely starts at the current position)
--
-- * here, alignment constraint /= 0 are somewhat subtle; they mean that is
--   the given number of bits doesn't fit in what's left in the current
--   storage unit, alignment to the start of the next storage unit has to be
--   triggered
