module Media.Streaming.GStreamer.Core.Clock (
  
-- * Detail
  -- | GStreamer uses a global clock to synchronize the plugins in a
  --   pipeline. Different clock implementations are possible by
  --   implementing this abstract base class.
  --   
  --   The 'Clock' returns a monotonically increasing time with the
  --   method 'clockGetTime'. Its accuracy and base time depend
  --   on the specific clock implementation but time is always
  --   expressed in nanoseconds. Since the baseline of the clock is
  --   undefined, the clock time returned is not meaningful in itself,
  --   what matters are the deltas between two clock times. The time
  --   returned by a clock is called the absolute time.
  --   
  --   The pipeline uses the clock to calculate the stream
  --   time. Usually all renderers synchronize to the global clock
  --   using the buffer timestamps, the newsegment events and the
  --   element's base time, see GstPipeline.
  --   
  --   A clock implementation can support periodic and single shot
  --   clock notifications both synchronous and asynchronous.
  --   
  --   One first needs to create a 'ClockID' for the periodic or
  --   single shot notification using 'clockNewSingleShotID' or
  --   'clockNewPeriodicID'.
  --   
  --   To perform a blocking wait for the specific time of the
  --   'ClockID' use 'clockIDWait'. This calls can be interrupted with
  --   the 'clockIDUnschedule' call. If the blocking wait is
  --   unscheduled a return value of 'ClockUnscheduled' is returned.
  --   
  --   Periodic callbacks scheduled async will be repeadedly called
  --   automatically until it is unscheduled. To schedule a sync
  --   periodic callback, 'clockIDWait' should be called repeatedly.
  --   
  --   The async callbacks can happen from any thread, either provided
  --   by the core or from a streaming thread. The application should
  --   be prepared for this.
  --   
  --   A 'ClockID' that has been unscheduled cannot be used again for
  --   any wait operation; a new 'ClockID' should be created.
  --   
  --   It is possible to perform a blocking wait on the same 'ClockID'
  --   from multiple threads. However, registering the same 'ClockID'
  --   for multiple async notifications is not possible, the callback
  --   will only be called for the thread registering the entry last.
  --   
  --   These clock operations do not operate on the stream time, so
  --   the callbacks will also occur when not in the playing state as
  --   if the clock just keeps on running. Some clocks however do not
  --   progress when the element that provided the clock is not
  --   playing.
  --   
  --   When a clock has the 'ClockFlagCanSetMaster' flag set, it can
  --   be slaved to another 'Clock' with 'clockSetMaster'. The clock
  --   will then automatically be synchronized to this master clock by
  --   repeatedly sampling the master clock and the slave clock and
  --   recalibrating the slave clock with 'clockSetCalibration'. This
  --   feature is mostly useful for plugins that have an internal
  --   clock but must operate with another clock selected by the
  --   GstPipeline. They can track the offset and rate difference of
  --   their internal clock relative to the master clock by using the
  --   'clockGetCalibration' function.
  --   
  --   The master\/slave synchronisation can be tuned with the
  --   the 'clockTimeout', 'clockWindowSize' and 'clockWindowThreshold' properties.
  --   The 'clockTimeout' property defines the interval to
  --   sample the master clock and run the calibration
  --   functions. 'clockWindowSize' defines the number of samples to
  --   use when calibrating and 'clockWindowThreshold' defines the
  --   minimum number of samples before the calibration is performed.
