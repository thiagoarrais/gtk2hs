# see glib-genmarshal(1) for a detailed description of the file format,
# possible parameter types are:
#   VOID        indicates   no   return   type,  or  no  extra
#               parameters. if VOID is used as  the  parameter
#               list, no additional parameters may be present.
#   BOOLEAN     for boolean types (gboolean)
#   CHAR        for signed char types (gchar)
#   UCHAR       for unsigned char types (guchar)
#   INT         for signed integer types (gint)
#   UINT        for unsigned integer types (guint)
#   LONG        for signed long integer types (glong)
#   ULONG       for unsigned long integer types (gulong)
#   ENUM        for enumeration types (gint)
#   FLAGS       for flag enumeration types (guint)
#   FLOAT       for single-precision float types (gfloat)
#   DOUBLE      for double-precision float types (gdouble)
#   STRING      for string types (gchar*)
#   BOXED       for boxed (anonymous but reference counted) types (GBoxed*)
#   POINTER     for anonymous pointer types (gpointer)
#   OBJECT      for GObject or derived types (GObject*)

# If you add a new signal type, please check that it actually works!
# If it is a Boxed type check that the reference counting is right.

# This is for the GConfClient value_changed signal
