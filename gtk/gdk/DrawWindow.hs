-- A primitive window.
--
--  * This abstract type represents an on-screen window. Since it is derived
--    from 'Drawable', all methods defined there can be used.
--
--  * Every widget usually has a 'DrawWindow' into which it draws its
--    content. 'DrawWindow's become useful when the user creates
--    custom widgets using the 'DrawingArea' skeleton.
--
-- TODO
--
--  * This abstract type corresponds to a @gdk_window@. There seems to be no
--    functions of interest that operate on @gdk_window@s.
