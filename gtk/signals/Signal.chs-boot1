--- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  * These functions are used to connect signals to widgets. They are auto-
--    matically created through HookGenerator.hs which takes a list of possible
--    function signatures that are included in the GTK sources 
--    (gtkmarshal.list).
--
--- DOCU ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  * The object system in the second version of GTK is based on GObject from
--    GLIB. This base class is rather primitive in that it only implements
--    ref and unref methods (and others that are not interesting to us). If
--    the marshall list mentions OBJECT it refers to an instance of this 
--    GObject which is automatically wrapped with a ref and unref call.
--    Structures which are not derived from GObject have to be passed as
--    BOXED which gives the signal connect function a possiblity to do the
--    conversion into a proper ForeignPtr type. In special cases the signal
--    connect function use a PTR type which will then be mangled in the
--    user function directly. The latter is needed if a signal delivers a
--    pointer to a string and its length in a separate integer.
--
--- TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  * Check if we need all prototypes mentioned in gtkmarshal.list.
