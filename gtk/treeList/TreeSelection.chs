-- A 'TreeSelection' is a data type belonging to a 'TreeModel'. As the name
-- suggests it holds the current selection which can even be a multiple
-- choice.
--
-- TODO
--
-- * treeSelectionGetSelected allows to retreive the associated TreeModel
--   object. We currently do not use this feature so it could be added
--   if needed.
